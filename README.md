# ElevateLabs-Task-2
First thing I downloaded a suspecious mail header from Github.
Then I uploaded that header to "Google Admin toolbox messageheader". It gave the output SPF - Temperror, DKIM-none, DMARC - Temperror. All the 3 authetication came as an error confirming that the email is phishing. The MessageId is generated by a generic, suspicious-looking server name (ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb...). Legitimate users use servers that clearly reflect their domain name. I also compared it with legitimate email header.
